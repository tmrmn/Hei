- thesis on how to understand WikilLeaks with Immanuel Kant (Principle of publicity from his Work "On Perpetual Peace" )
- after my Ba I started a Job as a project manager and coordinator in the field of arts and culture education in Berlin. During the four years I worked at a not for profit organasation I was invovlved in several projects. My last task was to build-up a network platform for actors in the arts and cultural education scene of berlin. The project Kubinaut was designed to build up a central hub where you can get information on the scene, like news, help with getting your projects funded, event calenders and so on but also, a place that you can use to represent yourself or your institution online and document your ongoing and conducted projects. The online part can be found on www.kubinaut.de :in the meantime there are about 500 active Profiles of (insituttions and indivitual actors) that have 130 projects. In total there close to 1300 Projects on the platform. The online representation was (or is) accompanied by network meetings, bigger conferences and also small workshops ( on fr example copyright issues, classes on how to strengthen your online  )
